    "description": "For this AVAnnotate project, I have created annotations for this literary performance by Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye reciting Sarah's poem \"When Love Arrives.\" The poem explains the evolution from young naive love to mature love with a storytelling or conversational tone. The annotations will aid in engaging with the poem to the fullest and its role in understanding how we perceive ourselves in the world. Additionally, the annotations will note on the shifts from young love to mature love, as well as other themes of relatability, impact of spoken-word poetry, and the uses of different literary devices within the poem.",
